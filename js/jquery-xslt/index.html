<h1>XSLT v0.70</h1>

This is a jQuery Plugin for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ajaxslt/">Google's AJAXSLT</a>. It gives you the
ability to transform XML/XSL from JavaScript. AJAXSLT is a parser itself, the library does not depend on 
your browser being able to do XSL transforms. The plugin also provides functionality to load XML/XSL through
$.ajax() calls and transform them.<br />

<h1>Reference</h1>

<h2>Reference - $.xslt.version</h2>

Object with two members: <b>plugin</b> and <b>ajaxslt</b>.

<a name="reference_texttoxml" />
<h2>Reference - $.xslt.textToXML(text)</h2>

Converts a text string containing XML to an XML node usable by AJAXSLT. Really just calls the <b>xmlParse</b>
function from AJAXSLT. It only exists to provide a jQuery-like function for a common operation.<br />

<a name="reference_xmltotext" />
<h2>Reference - $.xslt.xmlToText(xml)</h2>

Converts an XML node to a text string. Really just calls the <b>xmlText</b> function from AJAXSLT.
It only exists to provide a jQuery-like function for a common operation.<br />

<a name="reference_xslt" />
<h2>Reference - $.xslt(options)</h2>

This is the core of the XSLT plugin and together with the <b>$(...).xslt(options)</b> function probably
all you need to use and know about.<br />
<br />
This function can take XML and XSL from text strings and XML nodes, if necessary retrieve them from the
server through <b>$.ajax()</b> calls both synchronously and asynchronously, use AJAXSLT to do the 
transformation and provide that back as return value or to a callback or assign it to DOM elements. It
also provides caching.<br />
<br />
<b>Parameters</b><br />
All parameters are passed through the <b>options</b> object. Members:
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>xml</b> / <b>xsl</b> (<b>null</b>): A text string or XML/DOM node representing XML or XSL. Omit or set
		to <b>null</b> to use the URL variants instead.<br />
		<br />	
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>xmlUrl</b> / <b>xslUrl</b> (<b>null</b>): URLs to retrieve the XML/XSL from. These are only used if the
		<b>xml</b> or <b>xsl</b> members are set to <b>null</b>. Note that you can load one from an URL and provide
		the other normally without issue.<br />
		<br />		
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>xmlCache</b> / <b>xslCache</b> (<b>true</b>): Use the internal cache? If set to <b>true</b> (default),
		XML/XSL loaded externally through the <b>xmlUrl</b> and <b>xslUrl</b> members are saved to and loaded
		from an internal cache. If set to <b>false</b>, this cache will not be used - note that the results will
		also not be saved to the cache. Also note that if you set this to false, you still need to take measures
		like sending the correct headers and maybe using a parameter in the URL to make sure the data is not
		pulled from the browser cache.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>callback</b> (<b>null</b>): Function to call when the transformation is complete. The callback function
		is passed one parameter: the transformed data (as a text string). The parameter will be <b>false</b> if
		an error has occured.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>target</b> (<b>null</b>): A target to assign with the results of the transform. The assignment is done
		by <b>$(target).html(result)</b>, so you can set <b>target</b> to a DOM element, a jQuery object, a string, 
		etc.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>dataTypeXML</b> (<b>false</b>): Use dataType = 'xml' in $.ajax calls? 'html' is used by default. This
		option is disabled by default. Advantages of using it is that the XML objects are created by the browser
		natively, which is probably faster than the JavaScript parser in AJAXSLT. Disadvantages are that Internet
		Explorer will choke if the correct headers are not sent, and ofcourse there <i>may</i> be differences in
		the parsing by the different browsers.<br />
	</li>
</ul>

<b>Return values</b><br />
The return value of the function can be either the transformed XML as a text string, <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>string</b>: The operation was successful, and the value is the transformed XML.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>true</b>: The operation has gone async and is working in the background. The callback, if any, will be called
		when the operation is complete and the target, if any, assigned with the result of the transform. See <b>Async
		vs. Sync</b> below for more information.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>false</b>: An error has occured. Note that this may also be passed to the callback function.<br />
	</li>
</ul>

<b>Async vs. Sync</b><br />
The function running Async or Sync depends on a number of factors.<br />
<br />
By default, the function runs sync, and returns the transformation result. However, if any files need to be loaded
through <b>$.ajax()</b> calls (which means that they are not in cache or caching is disabled) the function may go
async. However, it will <i>only</i> go async if either a callback or target is provided. If no callback or target is
provided, the <b>$.ajax()</b> calls will be made sync as well (which can make the browser temporarily unresponsive).<br />
<br />
Ofcourse, the callback function is called wether the function goes async or not.<br />

<a name="reference_xslt_jq" />
<h2>Reference - $(...).xslt(options)</h2>

This function is practically the same as the <b>$.xslt(options)</b> function. The differences are that
the <b>target</b> option is automatically set to the jQuery object and the function returns <b>this</b> to
maintain chainability instead of <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, or html.<br />

<!-- Notes -->

<a name="notes" />
<h1>Notes</h1>
AJAXSLT is a very nice library, but it does not implement XSLT in full. Most common things are supported
though. It also breaks fairly easily and it can be hard to find where the problem is at.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse, the plugin has not changed the AJAXSLT code, so it's function names run the risk of conflicting
with your own.<br />
