      <p>Description: 
         <span property="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description">A centurion and favorite of Nero, who rose to the rank of tribunus praetorianorum
            under Galba, Naso is known to have served as procurator of Pontus et Bithynia during
            at least the year AD 78. Some scholars think that he was the L. Antonius who seems
            to have settled a boundary between Thasos and Philippi, probably under the Flavians,
            (but others suggest an alternative identification: L. Antonius Saturninus). The choice
            of Naso has led some to list him as the proconsul of Macedonia under Vespasian; however,
            Papazoglou argues strenuously that the Antonius who settled the dispute – whatever
            his identity – was was a special legate of Vespasian.
