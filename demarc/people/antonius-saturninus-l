      <p>Description: 
         <span property="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description">Adlected to the senate by Vespasian, Saturninus was possibly propraetorian imperial
            legate of Iudaea between AD 78 and 81, then probably suffect consul in AD 82, and
            ultimately rebelled against Domitian in AD 89 as legate in Germania Superior. Some
            scholars identify him as the L. Antonius who seems to have settled a boundary between
            Thasos and Philippi, probably under the Flavians, but see also L. Antoninus Naso.
