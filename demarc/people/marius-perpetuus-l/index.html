      <p>Description: 
         <span property="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description">An individual whose name appears on a fragmentary inscription from Aunobari (Text
            41.2) which may record the members of a governor’s consilium as part of a boundary
            dispute ruling (see Instance 41). He is further described thereon as scriba quaestorius
            and, although he does not seem to have merited his own entry in PIR2, he is thought
            to have been the father of L. Marius Perpetuus, L. filius (PIR2 M313). The younger
            Perpetuus’ equestrian career under the emperor Marcus Aurelius is well-documented
            and included numerous procuratorial posts and a minor pontificate.
